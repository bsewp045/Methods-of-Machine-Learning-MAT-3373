Many maps show the western edge as Bronson Avenue, but some also include the triangle farther west formed by Bronson, Carling Avenue, and Dow's Lake. The Glebe Community Association uses the latter definition.[1] As of 2011, the area's population was 11,184.<br /><br />The Glebe has a strong community association which, in addition to running a large community centre, lobbies the local government on issues such as traffic calming and neighbourhood development. The Glebe has a community newspaper, Glebe Report, that has been published independently since 1973.<br /><br />The Glebe is mostly populated by families; the area has many children, and consequently its social services are oriented towards youth.
